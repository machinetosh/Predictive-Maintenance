The Predictive Maintenance project focused on leveraging computer vision techniques, specifically autoencoders, for anomaly detection.The project had a significant impact on the business, providing the following benefits: 

**Early Anomaly Detection**: By reconstructing images using autoencoders and comparing the reconstruction metric score, the project enabled the early detection of anomalies in equipment or processes. This allowed for timely intervention to prevent failures and minimize disruptions. 
**Improved Maintenance Planning**: The project's anomaly detection capabilities supported proactive maintenance planning by identifying potential issues before they escalated. This led to more efficient allocation of resources, reduced downtime, and optimized maintenance schedules.
**Cost Reduction**: By detecting anomalies early on the project helped minimize costly repairs, equipment breakdowns, and production losses.This resulted in cost savings for the organization and improved overall operational efficiency. 
**Enhanced Equipment Longevity**: The proactive nature of the anomaly detection system enabled timely maintenance interventions, extending the lifespan of critical equipment. This reduced the need for premature replacements and capital expenditure on new equipment. 
Autoencoders are deep learning models specifically designed for unsupervised learning tasks, such as data compression and reconstruction. In the Predictive Maintenance project, autoencoders were employed to reconstruct input images and evaluate the similarity between the original and reconstructed images. The following steps were involved: 
**Encoding**: The autoencoder model learned a compressed representation, or encoding, of the input images by mapping them to a lower-dimensional latent space. 
**Decoding**: The encoded representation was then decoded to reconstruct the original images. The goal was to minimize the reconstruction error and obtain a close approximation of the input images. 
**Reconstruction Metric and Threshold**: A reconstruction metric, such as mean squared error or structural similarity index, was computed to quantify the difference between the original and reconstructed images. A threshold was set to determine whether an image was normal or anomalous based on the reconstruction metric score. 
**Anomaly Detection**: Images with reconstruction metric scores exceeding the threshold were classified as anomalies, indicating potential faults or deviations from normal behavior. By utilizing autoencoders for anomaly detection, the project enabled businesses to proactively identify and address maintenance issues, resulting in improved operational efficiency, cost savings, and enhanced equipment reliability.
